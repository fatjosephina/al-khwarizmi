# al-khwarizmi
Welcome to Joseph Poselenzny's algorithm portfolio!

I'm a student in my senior year studying game design at Columbia College Chicago. My [>itch.io page<](https://fatjosephina.itch.io/) and my [>portfolio<](https://fatjosephina.wixsite.com/portfolio) are great places to see more of my work.

This is a repository to hold my algorithms which I have implemented in C#.
# Assignment I: Code Examples
This week, I made a program which demonstrates constant time (O(1)), linear time (O(n)), and quadratic time (O(n^2)). The source code also contains comments explaining how each method demonstrates my understanding of Big O notation.

# Assignment II: Fisher-Yates Shuffle
This week, I made a program which demonstrates the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm in two different ways. I included several classes in the same .cs file for easier comprehensibility when viewed on GitHub. The source code also contains comments explaining how it demonstrates my understanding of the Fisher-Yates shuffle, ways that my code is different from the source used, and improvements I would make if I were to continue working on the project.

# Assignment III: Data Structures
This week, I made a program which demonstrates the creation of an array, a map in the form of a hash table, a stack, and a queue. The source code also contains comments explaining the differences between an array and a map (hash table) and between a stack and a queue, how they work, and when to use each one. The program reads lines from a text file and adds them to each data structure.

# Assignment V: Sorting
This week, I made a program which demonstrates various sorting algorithms. The algorithms included are bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort. The source code also contains comments including descriptions of each one, best and worst runtimes, and pseudocode versions of these algorithms. The program reads numbers from a text file and sorts them using the different algorithms. It then prints the runtimes for how long each one took to sort the data and compares them in a summary.

# Assignment VI: Searching
This week, I made a program which demonstrates searching algorithms. The algorithms included are linear sort, binary sort, and interpolation sort. The source code also contains comments including descriptions of each one, best and worst runtimes, and pseudocode versions of these algorithms. The program reads numbers from a text file and sorts them using the different algorithms. It then prints the runtimes for how long each one took to sort the data and compares them in a summary.

# Assignment VII: Trees
This week, I made a program which demonstrates the creation of a tree, as well as searching in a tree. It does so using C#'s Dictionary class. The program reads numbers from a text file and adds them to a tree. It then searches the trees for some numbers and prints the results in a summary.
