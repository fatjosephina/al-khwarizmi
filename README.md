Welcome to my algorithm portfolio!

This is a repository to hold my algorithms.
# Week 1
This week, I made a program which demonstrates constant time (O(1)), linear time (O(n)), and quadratic time (O(n^2)). The source code also contains comments explaining how each method demonstrates my understanding of Big O notation.
