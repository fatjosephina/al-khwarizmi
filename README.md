Welcome to Joseph Poselenzny's algorithm portfolio!

This is a repository to hold my algorithms.
# Week 1
This week, I made a program which demonstrates constant time (O(1)), linear time (O(n)), and quadratic time (O(n^2)). The source code also contains comments explaining how each method demonstrates my understanding of Big O notation.

# Week 5
This week, I made a program which demonstrates the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm in two different ways. I included several classes in the same .cs file for easier comprehensibility when viewed on GitHub. The source code also contains comments explaining how it demonstrates my understanding of the Fisher-Yates shuffle, ways that my code is different from the source used, and improvements I would make if I were to continue working on the project.

# Week 8
This week, I made a program which demonstrates the creation of an array, a map in the form of a hash table, a stack, and a queue. The source code also contains comments explaining the differences between an array and a map (hash table) and between a stack and a queue, how they work, and when to use each one. The program reads lines from a text file and adds them to each data structure.
